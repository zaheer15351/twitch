# twitch app

A barebones PHP app that makes use of the [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) web framework, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.


## Deploying

Install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zaheer15351/twitch.git
$ cd php-getting-started
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

This app is already deployed on [Heroku](https://secure-springs-34454.herokuapp.com/).

## Task requirement

In this task, it was suppose to complete the following in 4 hours max

- The first/home page lets a user login with Twitch and set their favorite Twitch streamer name. This initiates a backend event listener which listens to all events for given streamer.
- The second/streamer page shows an embedded livestream, chat and list of 10 most recent events for your favorite streamer. This page doesnâ€™t poll the backend and rather leverages web sockets and relevant Twitch API.

## Scope covered

In the given timeframe, I managed to complete the following

- Home page that lets a user login with Twitch
- Streamer page that shows an embedded livestream and a chat box from a streamer

## Scope not covered

- I couldn't find any documentation for fetching Events from a streamer, although I created some events in my account and tried to show them on Streamer Page but twitch doesn't allowed it. 
- I couldn't manage to write a backend listener which listens to all events for a given streamer as in given timeframe I couldn't find any documentation for the API that fetches/listens for events created by streamer.

## Additional Questions to answer

- How would you deploy the above on AWS? (ideally a rough architecture diagram will help)
    - I will configure CodePipeline linked with GitHub's webhook to fetch source when there is any change.
    - Changes will be forwarded to CodeDeploy
    - CodeDeploy will be configured to deploy code over the designated Target group
    - Target group will be configured with one or more instances (based on auto-scaling configs)

- Where do you see bottlenecks in your proposed architecture and how would you approach scaling this app starting from 100 reqs/day to 900MM reqs/day over 6 months?
    - Initially, we can go with <b>Computer Optimized c5.large</b> Ec2 instance
    - We should have Auto scaling configured with minimum 1 and maximum 5 instances configurations
    - Autos scaling group should be configured with a scaling policy to scale up when <b>Average CPU Utilization </b> increases from 80%
    - If needed, we can modify our number of maximum instances in Auto scaling group.
